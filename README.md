## FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Project - Build a Pomodoro Clock

## User Stories

- [ ] I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed. 
- [ ] I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
- [ ] I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

## Thoughts

This is where I wasn't all that successful with design part, but what was important for me is to implement some truly useful functionality. Thing is I've been using Pomodoro timers for years and I have some ideas. In this project you can save any number of custom Pomodoro timers, but that is not the main feature! The best is that whenever timer ends it doesn't stop counting your time, and the same goes for breaks too! What it means is that this Pomodoro Timer counts your true time and even saves the log for later perusal. You will always know exactly how long you worked and how long were your breaks!
